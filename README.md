🏠 Airbnb Clone – Booking Management System
A full-featured clone of Airbnb focused on building a robust Booking Management System. This application simulates the core experience of property rental platforms with emphasis on both frontend functionality and a powerful Django-based backend API.

🚀 Objective
To develop a production-grade booking system that supports:

Secure user authentication
Property listing & management
Booking lifecycle management
Online payments
User reviews
Built using Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, and modern web technologies, this project is a hands-on demonstration of software architecture, scalable design, and API-first thinking.

🏆 Project Goals
🔐 User Management – Register, login, manage profile securely
🏡 Property Listings – List, edit, delete properties
📅 Booking System – Book and manage stays
💳 Payment Processing – Integrated with Stripe
⭐ Review System – Rate and review properties
⚙️ Data Optimization – Caching, indexing, async tasks
👥 Team Roles
Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and core business logic.

Database Administrator
Designs and manages the database schema, indexes, and ensures data consistency and performance.

DevOps Engineer
Sets up and manages deployment pipelines, containerization, monitoring, and scaling of backend services.

QA Engineer
Tests features manually and through automation to ensure the system meets functional and non-functional requirements.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend logic and RESTful APIs.

Django REST Framework (DRF)
Facilitates creating REST APIs for seamless integration with frontend.

PostgreSQL
Relational database system used to store and manage all project data.

GraphQL
Provides a powerful query language for precise and efficient data fetching from the frontend.

Redis
Used for caching and session management to improve application performance.

Celery
Handles asynchronous background tasks such as sending confirmation emails and processing payments.

Docker
Enables containerized development and deployment environments.

GitHub Actions
Used for CI/CD to automate testing, building, and deployment.

🧩 Feature Breakdown
User Management
Handles registration, login, profile updates, and host verification. Provides access control and session handling.

Property Management
Allows users to create, edit, view, and delete their rental listings with images, descriptions, and prices.

Booking System
Enables users to select dates and book available properties, ensuring no booking conflicts and handling booking status.

Payment Integration
Facilitates secure payment processing using Stripe and links payments to bookings.

Review System
Allows users to leave reviews and ratings after their stay, helping maintain trust within the platform.

🔒 API Security
Authentication: Uses JWT tokens to ensure only logged-in users can access protected endpoints.
Authorization: Role-based permissions to separate user and host functionalities.
Rate Limiting: Protects API endpoints from abuse and DDoS attacks.
Input Validation & Sanitization: Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and other common attacks.
Why it Matters:

Protects sensitive user data and financial transactions.
Ensures system integrity and reliability.
Builds user trust and legal compliance.
⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?
CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) ensures code is automatically tested, built, and deployed every time changes are made, reducing bugs and speeding up delivery.

Tools Used
GitHub Actions – Automates code linting, testing, and deployment.
Docker – Provides containerized environments for build and deployment.
PostgreSQL + Redis services – Used in integration testing via CI workflows.
